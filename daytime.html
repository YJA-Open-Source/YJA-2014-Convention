      <h3>Nimesh Patel</h3>
      <h4 class="subheader">Keynote Speaker</h4>
      <p>
      From Wharton Business School to Wall Street, to fame and fortune as a MTV Rap star, at some point along Nimo's journey he realized that he was walking a path of suffering and that the only path to light was through selfless service to others and his own internal purification. In his mid-twenties, he abandoned the limelight and found himself meditating in the foothills of the Himalayas. There, an inner voice nudged him to radically simplify his life and find his purpose in service to others. He moved to the Gandhi Ashram in India and dedicated himself to the children in the surrounding slums. Fast-forward to April 2012: Nimo and a dance troupe of sixteen of "his kids" toured the world with "Ekatva" -- a performance whose ultimate message was Oneness. Read more about Nimo's inspired journey of transforming a motley crew of kids from the slums into global emissaries of unity: <a href="http://www.dailygood.org/story/226/finding-nimo-rap-star-s-journey-with-16-slum-kids/" target="_blank">A Rap Star&#39;s Journey With 16 Slum Kids</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      Nimo has recently embarked on a project to bridge selfless service, love and music. He calls it Empty Hands Music. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrVHarNCaYA&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">this video</a> which captures the spirit of what Nimo’s Empty Hands Music is all about.

The ascetics have concluded that in order to achieve good health one needs self-restraint and a heightened awareness. One needs to exercise control by restraining oneself from excessive food, desires, possessions, and talking. In order to achieve control over these things it is essential to develop a keen awareness of them. Only then can one be completely healthy. Jain monks and nuns exemplify a lifestyle that is based on self-restraint and awareness, and it is these abilities that are the secrets of their health and happiness." data-original-title="Samani Parimal Pragyaji and Samani Vikas Pragyaji" data-placement="right" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" href="javascript:;">

We often forget that universal compassion also means compassion for ourselves. As Asian-American youth, we are pressured to succeed as students and excel as leaders, but we also face the highest rates of suicide and depression in the country. If we ignore our own needs, then how can we care for others and give as leaders?

                <a class="sessions-popover" data-content="Jain karma philosophy is inherently spiritual in nature; however, it is often misconstrued in a dogmatic fashion. When someone suffers, some Jains think it is due to his karma and he should endure the suffering. They think we should not get involved in compassion and charity work, because if a person commits any sin after their help, they will acquire bad karma and ultimately we will have to suffer. These types of interpretations discredit the Jain religion.
