          To provide each attendee with hotel accommodations, meals, and the opportunity to attend sessions and social events, the actual total cost per person is $400.00 for HS/college students and $440.00 for JNF attendees. YJA works very hard in fundraising during the year to help subsidize each attendee's cost of attendance by $105.00. We would greatly appreciate it if you could help YJA by choosing the "Unsubsidized" pricing option at the time of payment. This would help us raise the money we need to ensure YJA remains affordable for as many potential attendees as possible.
