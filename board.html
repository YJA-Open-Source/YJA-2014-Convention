This is Sunny’s first convention, and he is looking forward to meeting people from all over the nation. His hobbies and interests include community service, inspirational books, the Kansas City Chiefs, and most of all, long-distance running (all you Bostonian Jains: please go and support Sunny at the 2015 Boston Marathon). Sunny loved his first year of YJA, and he would like to give a shout out to his Boardie family, his Fundraising team, and his fellow Kansans and Michiganders!

        Vaishali was born and raised in sunny Orlando, FL (yes, by Disney and Harry Potter World). She currently just graduated from pharmacy school at the University of Florida (Go Gators!!!) and is a licensed pharmacist. She enjoyed working with Adult Volunteers during YJA 2012 so she decided to do it again in hopes that they will not try to marry her off this time. When Vaishali is not busy studying about new drugs, you can find her cooking different recipes, catching up on TV shows, and obnoxiously singing Bollywood songs. She hopes everyone has an amazing time during this convention!
